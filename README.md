1. List most common portuguese verbs and adjectives
1. Create combinations of verbs used in a negative sense and verbs in a positive sense
1. Get a sentiment analysis model trained on twitter or something like that for portuguese
1. Split existing emotions between the three groups of positive, neutral and negative?

   More Negative << >> More Positive
   Negative: angry sad embarrassed no
   Neutral: nervous confused thinking
   Positive: yes happy suprised smug

If a toot is extremely negative, search between angry-sad words
If a toot is somewhat negative, search between embarrassed-no-neutral words
If a toot is neutral, search between neutral words
If a toot is somewhat positive, search between yes-happy-neutral words
If a toot is extremely positive, search between yes happy

For this to work, we would need to have repeating verbs and adjectives in every sentiment group.

How could I split verbs/adjectives to each reaction?
